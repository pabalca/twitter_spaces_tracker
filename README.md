# twitter_spaces_tracker
Webapp to track the spaces of your favourite Twitter accounts.

You can add @accounts to track and it will scrape their timeline searching for the spaces links and also gathering some stats such as participant count and duration, so I can choose where to better spend my time. Main page shows the latests 20 spaces. In the "accounts" page you can add (need a token) and display the whole history of any account. Also there is a tab for "scheduled" spaces.
